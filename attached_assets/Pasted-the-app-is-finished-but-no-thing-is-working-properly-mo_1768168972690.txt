the app is finished but no thing is working properly :
* most of apis endpoints doesnt match the backend 
* screens are not proffessional and they are as you are a kid drawing
* user ,charity,driver flow are ignored from you when you code 
* i need the app to work properly 


what you should do:
* read the reppoo for admin-mobile and see the file that i will send to you about the apis responses and excpectations and documentations then see if there is a miss match 
* concerning the UI 
I need you to modify the existing ReWear mobile application UI with these specific enhancements:
1. Bottom Navigation Bar - Create a fixed-position bottom navigation bar with these 4 tabs in this exact order:
   * Home (House icon) - Default active state
   * Cart (Shopping cart icon) - Include a badge notification for items in cart
   * Orders (Clipboard list icon)
   * Profile (User icon)
The navbar should be:
   * Fixed at the bottom with appropriate safe area padding
   * Use a professional green color scheme (#2A9D8F primary, #21867A for active states)
   * Include both icons and labels for each tab
   * Have smooth hover/active state transitions
   * Show a subtle scale animation when tabs are tapped
2. Profile Screen - Design a clean, professional profile interface that includes:
   * Header Section:
      * User avatar (circular with initials or image)
      * User name and email displayed prominently
      * Edit button for profile modifications
   * Statistics Grid (3-column layout showing):
      * Total Orders count
      * Active Listings count
      * Donations Made count
   * Settings Menu (vertical list with icons):
      * My Listings (shopping bag icon)
      * Favorites (heart icon)
      * Addresses (location icon)
      * Privacy & Security (shield icon)
      * Help & Support (question mark icon)
   * Logout Button at the bottom
Key Requirements:
* Maintain the existing professional green color palette (#2A9D8F primary)
* Use consistent spacing (8px grid system)
* Include proper hover, active, and disabled states
* Follow accessibility standards (contrast ratios, tap targets)
* Keep animations subtle (150-300ms duration)
* Ensure the design feels "calm, trustworthy, and human" as per the original design philosophy
